            Super tic-tac-toe is a variant of the classic tic-tac-toe game: in each cell of the classic 3x3 grid, there's another 3x3 grid. <br>
            <img class="campotris" src="risorse/campoSuperTris.png" alt="Super tic-tac-toe board"> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The first player plays an X wherever they want on the board;</li>
                <li>Depending on where X played their move, O is forced to respond in the small board indicated by the previous move
                    (e.g. X plays in a center square of the top left 3x3 grid, O must play in the central 3x3 grid);</li>
                <li>The second player will do the same, now forcing X to play in a specific small board.</li>
                <li>Whenever a small board is completed, it counts as won by the player who would've normally won the tic-tac-toe game played inside it.
                    (if it's a tie, the small board stays unclaimed).</li>
                <li>If a player is forced to play in a completed small board, they can play wherever they want.</li>
                <li>The game ends either when a player wins the larger board, or when there are no more legal moves (in which case it's a draw).</li>
            </ul>
